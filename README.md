Week 5 Assignment
1. MAGIC EIGHT BALL PROJECT.
Make a program that generates one of these answers when I ask a question.
2. Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an
array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.
Examples
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35] arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84,
96, 108, 120] arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
3. Fibonacci Sequence
Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers.
Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . Each
subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
